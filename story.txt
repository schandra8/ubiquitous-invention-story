There was once was a man named Peter Pangea who lived long ago in a place far, far away. He had a sidekick named Le'veon Bell, who is a dawg at what he does. Together, they constantly fight their arch-nemesis, Adam "The Terror" Gase, who would constantly annoy them.

One day, Peter and Le'veon, better known as Leo, were ballin it up on the hoops in their town. It was a typical 1-on-1 game to see who was truly the better player, yet Leo always won. Out of nowhere, The Terror showed up to challenge them to a game. However, it would be a 3-on-3 game, so Peter and Leo needed to find another partner to help them in their game.

They recruited Tom Brady for the job. They figured that Tom would be able to pass the ball around well and Leo could then use his hops to elevate and catch the ball for a slam dunk. Peter was not critical to the team's success, so he mainly tried to stay out of the way. As the game began, it seemed that the strategy was working. Tom was giving Leo good opportunities to score points, and Leo was taking advantage of The Terror's lack of athleticism by jumping over him for dunks. However, as the game progressed, Tom's shoulder began to ache, and his throwing became worse and worse.
