There was once was a man named Peter Pangea who lived long ago in a place far, far away. He had a sidekick named Le'veon Bell, who is a dawg at what he does. Together, they constantly fight their arch-nemesis, Adam "The Terror" Gase, who would constantly annoy them.

One day, Peter and Le'veon, better known as Leo, were ballin it up on the hoops in their town. It was a typical 1-on-1 game to see who was truly the better player, yet Leo always won. Out of nowhere, The Terror showed up to challenge them to a game. However, it would be a 3-on-3 game, so Peter and Leo needed to find another partner to help them in their game.
